TODO LIST

1. Complete askitapi.js
2. Change api calls to basic server calls for the time being i suppose.
3. Complete login screen, meaning a 'User' state must be maintained.

//Really slow process I know, but learning a lot in the process and that is rather important IMO.

Give nup on doing backend api for now. Gonna be doing simple user login and access token exchange. That is pretty complex in itself.

CHANGE DB CONNECTION IP TO SERVER IP
